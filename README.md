<h1>Mastermind</h1>
This is a ruby command line game implementation of the board game "Mastermind".

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

The game is played with code-breaker and a code-maker. User gets to choose between latter 2 choices and the computer takes on the opposite side.
Code-maker creates a 4 digit secret code using numbers between 1-6. Code-breaker on the other hand, tries to find out that secret code within 12 turns.
Each turns there is feedback/clue to guide the code-breaker to right direction. If the code is cracked within 12 turns, code-breaker wins and if not, 
code-maker wins the match.

This version is played with digits unlike the original board game which uses 6 different colors. 6 different colors of the game
is represented by digits 1 to 6.
